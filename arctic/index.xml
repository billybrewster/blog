&lt;p>I’m lying face down on the ground under 3 feet of snow, it’s -30 degrees Celsius and I’m unable to move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moments before I had been descending from the Tjäktja Pass on cross country ski’s pulling a pulk behind me. I was fully in control and everything was going well .. until it wasn’t.

&lt;p>When I heard the Spine team were going to be launching a race based in Arctic Sweden I was immediately interested but also very apprehensive. I have spent many a day and night in some pretty horrendous conditions in the UK but nothing like surviving in temperatures as low as -40 degrees C, strong winds and limited daylight hours.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
