What better an adventure to have over the long bank holiday jubilee weekend.
When planning the trip I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be able to cover the 96 miles in 3 days relatively comfortably.</description></item><item><title>Paddy Buckley 2022</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/fastpacking/paddy2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/fastpacking/paddy2022/</guid><description>I made an unsucessful attempt at a Paddy Buckley Round bak in 2018 (see write up https://robbrooks.run/running/paddybuckly2018/) and it&amp;rsquo;s been on my radar to have another go ever since but for a number of reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the chance to go back.
A free long weekend in April presented the opportunity to fastpack the route over 3 days - the forecast was dry and relatively warm but windy. Katherine was wanting to do some big miles in preparation for her upcoming Bob Graham Round (which she stormed round in 21 hours 42 mins) so I asked her if she wanted tto come along.</description></item><item><title>Cleveland Way 2021</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/fastpacking/clevelandway2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/fastpacking/clevelandway2021/</guid><description>The Cleveland Way
