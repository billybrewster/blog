The late cancellation of the Arctic Spine race which I was registered to run provided an opportunity to put myself on the start line of the UK edition once again. Training had gone well and I was looking forward to toe-ing the line without the chest infection and broken ribs which had accompanied me during last year’s race.

My brother Alan very kindly drove me down to Edale for the statuary pre-race registration. Registration consisted of preparing the runners for the forthcoming race by making them queue outside the  venue for over an hour in freezing conditions.

Finally we then drove to nearby Castleton YHA where we were staying the night.

Having dinner in the Youth Hostel I bumped into Rich Garland. He runs for Northumberland Fell Runners and I had seen his name many times on race results and I had met him briefly at the Cheviot Goat a month earlier. Little did I realise how entwined our paths would become in the forthcoming days.

Even though we were in a private room in the YHA which was also in an annex and quiet I slept terribly, only getting an hour or so sleep. I was feeling the early symptoms of a cold and had also developed a sore throat which usually develops into a cough.

I still felt the same when I got up. Although I didn’t feel like it was adversely affecting me at that point I made a decision to start more conservatorly than I had originally intended as I didn’t want to push myself too hard so early in the race when I didn’t feel 100%.

It was very similar conditions at the start to last year, the temperature hovering around 2 degrees and drizzly rain generally making the place quite miserable.

As we lined up at the start line I spotted Mark Smith – he’d sadly had to withdraw for the race last year because of illness and was back for another shot.

I also spotted Eddie Sutton – I didn’t know her personally but she runs a podcast with a friend of mine, Gary Thwaites, which I recognised her from so I said hi and wished her well for the race.

Kevin *** did his best to offer some pre race motivation : 

	The good news is I have an up to date weather forecast

The bad news is I have an up to date weather forecast.

Then we were off

** sore throat – difficult to swallow
      Ulcers on mouth

When Rich encouaraged me to push on he;d waited for me at Lothersdale.





Edale to Hebden Bridge

It felt good to be moving. Coming out of Edale I bumped into Darren Greasley who was out for a local run – he told me the conditions up high were grim and to make sure I had my goggles handy which I did.

Even just running the low level traverse from * to * wasn’t particularly pleasant running into a sleety headwind. A bunch of sheep were sheltering from the wind behind a wall – they had the right idea. I put my goggles on at the start of the climb up Jacobs ladder as I knew conditions would deteriorate further as I gained height.

The run over the Kinder Plateau and over Bleaklaw was very similar conditions to the previous year – windy, horizontal rain/sleet and very poor visibility. Many of the paths and slabs were under water and at times it felt like trying to run/walk through a river.

Coming off the Kinder Plateau there is a steep descent on slabs which were covered in water. I took this section very conservatorly  and was passed by an American runner who was descending quite aggressively more akin to a fell race as opposed to a 268 mile winter ultra. 

Coming down from Bleaklaw I finally left the clag behind and it had also stopped raining/snowing which was a welcome relief. I bumped into another friend Ishmahal Burdeau – he wasn’t aware I was doing the race and it was nice to stop and chat for a few minutes.

The next section from Torside up over Laddow Rocks and up o to Black Hill was incredibly wet and boggy too with a few fast flowing streams in spate to negotiate.  I ran/walked much of this section with a Malaysian runner, Alison Walker. She was hoping to be the first person from her country to complete the race.

She lived in Hebden Bridge but was originally from Malaysia. 

At one point she asked if I thought we were near the back of the field. I knew we were certainly no-where near the front of the field but in any case it didn’t matter.


I few months ago I’d developed a bone spur on the top of my right foot which was sporadically painful. I had completed the Cheviot Goat a few months earlier without it bothering me too much and I hoped it wouldn’t be a problem on the Spine but it had been bothering me from quite an early stage especially running downhill.

At the top of ** Alison pulled away from me and flew down the track. A part of me wanted to go with her but I resisted the urge.

 My foot was still letting me know it didn’t like running but even if it wasn’t I just felt like there was more to lose than to gain by taking the descent too aggressively and there was still a long way to go.

With ultras such as the Spine I really believe that the major gains you can make are later on the race if you can run whilst other people are walking even if it’s just a bimble. Most of the damage done to muscles, ligaments and tendons is done on descents so these need to be tackled conservaetly. 

It started to turn dark just after I passed the MRT station at **. My foot was getting increasingly more painful and I stopped briefly to loosen my laces as much as I could to try and release the pressure. A runner, Claire came past and asked if I was ok which I appreciated.

A little further on the pain hadn’t got any better so I stopped again to take some painkillers and also put another layer on as I had gotten really cold. Another couple of runners went past me and asked if I was ok.

That is one of the things I love about this race – it’s not cut throat, everyone looks after reach other. Turns out one of the lads is from the North East too and recognised my Geordie accent.

About 30 miles in the route crosses the M62 but just before there , there is an old shipping container that’s been converted into a café – Nicky’s food bar. I stopped briefly, but probably longer than I should have and consumed a cheeseburger, cup of tea and took some snacks for the trail.


As I was leaving Nicky’s Mark Smith was coming in – he’d just taken a fall in a bog and was covered in mud. I know he mentioned in his own blog that he was surprised to see me at this point and was concerned he was going too fast. In reality I don’t believe Mark gives himself the credit he deserves, he has a wealth of experience and has achieved some epic feats over the years. I briefly saw him again in Hebden and I’m pleased to report then he finished the race.

Shortly after leaving Nicky’s I caught up with Rich Garland. 

Sometimes in life you meet people and you just click straight away, you have the same sense of humour the same values, similar backgrounds and life experiences.

Rich was like that, even the brief moments I had spent with him the night before in the youth hostel we just clicked – there were no ego’s , no awkward silences just good craic.

We didn’t instantly make a decision to run together, our paces aligned and the craic was flowing so it was a natural thing to stick together which we did until Hebden. 

I asked what his plans were – he said he wanted to sort his feet out, eat and then get going again without sleeping. This was exactly what I wanted to do too so we agreed to stick together and leave together.

Coming down the road to the checkpoint we saw David Cummings coming back up, therefore at least an hour ahead of us if not more. I didn’t really know David, he runs for another North East Club and we have a lot of shared friends but I had never met him until now. By another twist of fate he had travelled down with Rich. He was obviously having a good race so far.

It was pretty busy at Hebden, I saw Eddie as we came in her race wasn’t going to plan. She had been feeling ill on the last section and promptly threw up the food she had just eaten upon arriving so the medics were holding her there until she could keep some food down.

The pain in my foothadn’t got any better so I sought advice from the medics. They strapped it up with some moleskin and k-tape to give it a bit padding.

We ate, faffed and then were ready to go y around 11-45. ! hour 20 mins in the checkpoint, not exactly a quick turnaround but at least I hadn’t spent 3 hours trying and failing to sleep like I had last year.




Hebden to Hawes

It was intimidating leaving Hebden. Its 65 miles to Hawes with around 8 hours of darkness ahead of us. It had taken me almost 24 hours to complete this section last year and facing this again when I’d already been going for 16 hours.

Still, one foot in front of the other, concentrate on getting to Lothersdale and bacon sarnies. The next section over a series of moorland and valleys was pretty uneventful and unremarkable given the distinct lack of views, however we made some decent progress. The temperature had dropped and the ground was starting to firm up with icy patches starting to develop.

As we descended into Lothersdale we spotted a sign proclaiming “Jasmin Paris is in Hawes”. 

We were both in need of a rest by then time we reached Lothersdale and decided to take 10 mins to try and get a power nap after greedily devouring our sarnines very kindly provided by thee XXX tri club. . This proved impossible sitting upright in a lightweight camping chair and in retrospect we should have just kept going after eating.

We saw Eddie here again, she was just leaving as we were arriving.

Preparing to leave a took a big swig of my cup of tea which was now luke warm and immediately I felt terrible. It felt like there was a missive rush of blood to my head and I felt dizzy, sick and thought I was going to pass out. 

Rich asked if I was ready to go to which I just about managed to reply that I thought I was going to be sick. I tried to find a sitting position that felt bearable and fought it as much as I could – I really couldn’t afford to lose that Bacon sarnie.

After around 10 minutes I started to come around and we set off up to Pinhaw Beacon.

I suspect that it was a massive sugar rush that did it, although it was a new phenomenon and not something I’ve experienced before (or would care to experience again in the future).

Daylight arrived by the time we reached Pinhaw, although sadly no spectacular sunrise was to be had it was grey and overcast.

Just after Gargrave we met John (Bootham). He was a Spine veteran having completed both the winter and summer editions of the race a number of times and we spent a bit of time walking and chatting with him.




I asked Rich what his plans at Hawes were. He said he was planning on 2/3 hours sleep and then push on. That was my plan too so we agreed to sleep for 3 hours and then leave together. 

Descending from the Cam road I felt physically more battered than I was last year. I had doms in my calf’s, quads and triceps and my lower back was hurting too.  I wasn’t quite sure why, my best guess is that last year although I didn’t manage to sleep at Hebden I lay down for 3 hours so that was 3 hours my body was repairing muscle damage that I didn’t have this year.

Rich was in a similar state of physical tiredness although we both agreed that from a sleep perspective we could have continued.

The gritters must have been on strike in Hawes as the paths and roads were covered in ice and lethal – it was the most dangerous part of the race so far.

It took ages to get my socks and shoes off as cramp kicked in every time I bent down.

Having now completed 2 Spine races I believe more than ever that the crux of the race is getting to Hawes in one piece and not totally broken. Know your plan and stick to it, and most importantly don’t worry about what anyone else is doing. 

Sean was already inside and we got chatting – he asked what my plan was and how long I was staying for. Eat, faff, sleep for 3 hours, eat faff leave. So about 9 hours lol.



`I popped some paracetamol and Sean asked why. I wasn’t really sure but everything was hurting so hopefully they would help something.


Hawes to Middleton


I managed around 2 hours sleep at Hawes 

One of the medics asked if I needed anything. My feet felt fine but I thought I might as well get them looked at as Rich was still bust taping his and looked like he’d be a while.

He didn’t find any hotspots or anything that needed attention and remarked that my feet were in great condition and some of the best he’d seen which was comforting and assurance that my foot care plan was working.

We briefly chatted to John Knapp who was setting off at the same time as us and then started the long climb up Great Shunner Fell. This was a real highlight of the race for me, I felt full of energy after a full English breakfast and the sunrise was amazing, just breaking as we reached the top.

Stopping briefly at Thwaite so Rich could take some painkillers we were passed by Sean O’Connor.

I met Sean during the Dragons Back in 2019 and have kept in touch ever since. 

Climbing out of Thwaite I started to feel sleepy even though it was a fanstastic day. I was actually really warm – the only time in the race that I was.

Rich was feeling the same so I suggested a quick 10 minute stop before climbing back up onto the moors. Rich lay down on a bench, I just plopped down on the ground.

It felt blissful – the gentle roar of the nearby waterfall was soothing and I could have stayed there forever.

10 minutes gone and I stripped off to my mod layers before the stiff climb onto the moor.

Once back in the wind the warmth disappeared, and I was soon pulling my jacket back on again.

As we arrived at Tan Hill Sean was getting ready to depart. We stopped briefly resisting the lure of a pub meal and set off over Sleeighholme Moor.
This area is normally like the Somme, but thankfully the bogs were frozen so we made decent progress. It isn’t a particularly stimulating section so it was just a case of grinding it out for a couple of hours.

By the time we had reached God’s bridge the temperature had dropped significantly so we stopped to put on our down jackets in the shelter of the subway. One of the event photographers came racing into the subway – “why aren’t you sleeping? Your trackers say you are sleeping”. We had to explain that was just because we had briefly stopped and that in fact the tracker wasn’t intelligent enough to know if we were awake or not.

The next section over to Middleton was an uneventful trudge with dark falling around half way in.  Cresting the brow of the hill looking down into Middleton was welcome and quite a nice run down under normal circumstances, however Rich’s knee was giving him gyp so we just took it easy.

The smell of the chippy in Middleton was appealing as we passed, however the thoughts of eating outside in the freezing cold less so.

Entering the checkpoint I was greeted by Gary Thwaites who was volunteering there for a couple of days. It was good to see a friendly face.

Eddie was here too having some food before preparing to leave – I was glad she’d made it to Middleton after the problems she’d had earlier in the race. 

Sean was her too having arrived before us – he asked what our plans were. We planned to sleep for 3 hours and then leave 1am. He asked if he could tag along with us which we both agreed to.

I had a blissful sleep at Bellingham, pretty much a full unbroken 3 hours although it never feels good to get up.



Middleton to Alston

We made decent progress along the first section by the Tees and caught up with John who had set off just before us.

Climbing up just past High force we were battling a bitterly cold headwind 

After the brief excitement of Cauldren Snout we were treated to a never ending section of bridleway followed by another never ending section of singletrack. There was no craic in this section, it was dark and cold and miserable we moved together in single file battling the headwind and our own negative thoughts.

We eventually reached High Cup Nick just as the first light of day began to illuminate the sky and just like that everyone’s mood changed. We were sheltered from the wind and a new day was about to dawn. The craic resumed and we were met by one of Rich’s mates who had come up to see him. 

The descent to Dufton was magical – we were treated to another wonderful sunrise and stimulated by the far reaching views across the Eden Valley to the snow covered mountains of the Lake District.



Alston to Bellingham

The quality of the conversation took a downward turn on this section - we were getting used to each others boundaries, and the boundaries were low. Most of it isn’t publically repeatable but it lead to some truly laugh out loud moments and definitely helped us get through this section.


The sleeping facilities in Bellingham consist of a large unheated hall. Upon entering I was immediately struck on how cold it was. It was below zero outside and didn’t feel much warmer in here. A tiny electric heater in the corner of the room was about as effective as trying to heat the Albert Hall with a match.

I grabbed my down jacket from my bag but this and my meagre sleeping bag wasn’t enough to warm me and I spent 2 hours shivering and not sleeping.

Rich was already getting his feet taped when I got up, although I had to wake Sean up as he’d overslept.

More food and kit check and I was ready to go – Sean and Rich were still faffing so I took the opportunity to 

Along the wall I felt a bit of a hotspot on the back of my right heel so we stopped and Sean quickly taped it for me whilst Bagpuss Garland had a quick power nap.

Luckily we didn’t have to follow the previous year’s awful diversion around  the forest , but there was still a smaller diversion to navigate which added on a few miles. It was pretty bland and uninteresting, but Sean set a good pace through here – he’d spotted another runner up in front and was keen to catch him.



Bellingham to Kirk Yetholm

We set off at a good pace and excitement in the prospect of catching a few runners ahead of us. This helped get through the section to Byrness where John was leaving to start the climb up Byrness hill just as we were arriving.

The mid checkpoint at the Forest View was very welcome as was the mince and mashed potato. The team here was awesome including Sharon Dyson. She seems to be involved in supporting everything going . This is another great thing about the Spine (and many other ultras). A lot of the volunteers are runners themselves but even if they aren’t they understand what the runners are going through and what they need. 

 
We posed for a photo just before leaving  - I don’t know what problems he had going on down there but I don’t think Rich appreciated me pinching his arse judging by his squeals of pain. We all had a good laugh about it anyway (well maybe apart from Rich).


We saw Marco C here who was getting his feet taped and was clearly in a lot of pain. 


None of us slept in the church, the rest and food at Byrness had temporarily revived me and I didn’t feel that sleepy. Plus it was absolutely Baltic and the wooden pews were far from comfortable. 

In retrospect we should have just pushed on.

We passed Marco on the top of Byrness Hill, he was clearly in a lot of pain but was bravely soldering on. We chatted briefly, wished each other good luck and then parted ways (I’m glad to report that Marco made it to the end). 

This is a very common occurrence in ultra races such as the Spine. You start off with great intentions and high hopes, and then something goes wrong. It might be a foot problem – blisters, swelling. It could be tendonitis, shin splints, back pain , foot pain , pain EVERYWHERE.

Then your race switches from anything you had previously planned and its just about survival, about getting to the finish. It’s about a deathmarch. I’ve been in this situation many times, although mercifully never on the Spine. 

This is where you learn a lot about yourself this is where the “why” really matters. Because if it doesn’t matter enough you will give up.

This is where I don’t think enough exposure is given to people further down the field in ultras, the coverage is normally focused on the front end of the field.

Whilst this exciting, most people simply are unable to relate to this – they will never be at that level and their race is very different.

They are moving more slowly, therefore not able to generate as much heat to stay warm, they are out on the course for longer so they need to carry more clothing and more food therefore their packs are heavier, therefore they more slowly.

I say “they” but really it should be “we”. I’m never going to be anywhere the same standard as Damian Hall (even though I’m the same age as him), but what does inspire me is the story of the 60/70 old who is still running and competing in these type of races. That’s where I want to be.



We spotted a signpost – 2 miles to Lamb Hill. I’m very familiar with this section but for some reason it seemed unfamiliar. Snow covered the ground and we were mostly following footprints, but then they would sometimes disappear, or lead us off the path so we were constantly battling to stay on track.

At one point we stopped for a pee break and Rich fell asleep leading on his poles, only to awaken to use gone not realising we’d left him behind.

I’ve never wanted anything to come more than the hut. I was falling asleep on my feet and staggering all over the place – I just couldn’t seem to keep my balance and without my poles I reckon I’d have been on the deck on more than one occasion.

Finally it did and I collapsed onto one of the benches – the MRT team were there.

We spent around 20/30 minutes there, I went from felling like I was asleep but had an awareness of people around me talking, rattling and coming and going – it was a very strange sensation.

When I did wake up properly I was 
One of the SST came into the hut and asked if any of us were Rob Brooks or Rich Garland. 

Yes that’s us!

I’ve got a message from Mark Clarkson asking after you both – he says I bet they’re cold as f*ck!

Yes I was as cold as f*ck. In fact I was colder than 100 f*cks, perhaps the coldest I’ve felt in my life.

Luckily there is a climb up to Lamb Hill which I powered up as fast as I could to try and warm up which I managed to do so by the time we reached Beefstand Hill.

Dawn had now arrived and I felt a million times better, we all did.

The Cheviots are stunning, even more so when they are covered in snow and I really enjoyed the next section to the end. It was hard going from Windy Gyle to Cheviot and the snow was knee deep and the first through it unfortunately hadn’t managed to find the stone slabbed path hidden underneath and instead had forged a track through the thick heather but Sean again set a good pace here and we could see both John up ahead and another small group of 3 runners.

Could we catch them? The chase was on.

Unfortunately the chase ended on Auchorpe Cairn as Rich’s knee was f*cked and he couldn’t run downhill. I blasted this section last year and has visions of doing the same this year – Rich even suggested we push on without him.

That felt like completely the wrong thing to do though, we’d come so far together now and the thought of not finishing together was unthinkable.

So we completed the last section to the end together, Sean jokingly suggested a sprint finish which none of us were up for, although somehow he managed to finish 20 seconds ahead of us despite us all crossing the line at the same time.

So my time for the race was 126 hours (5. Days and 6 hours) – just over an hour slower than last year albeit over a longer route (271 miles as opposed to 260 last year with the removal of thee Bellingham-> Byrness section) so faster in real terms. My moving time was slower than last year, but I spent less time in checkpoints.

Epilogue

This years race was a very different experience to last year – last year I spent the vast majority of the race alone including most of the night sections. This year I spent more of less the entire race with Richard and Sean from Middleton. 

There’s pros and cons to both – ultimately if your goal is to be competitive then I think you have to run primarily alone. Running with others you are always bound by the slowest person whether that be slowest in checkpoints or out on the trail and it isn’t always the same person. If you are feeling really good then you can’t really push on unless everyone feels the same otherwise you end up dropping people and then having to wait for them. Similarly people have bad patches at different points.

Conversely if you are feeling bad and others are moving faster it can motivate you to dig a bit deeper to keep pace or to faff a little less in checkpoints because everyone else is waiting for you. You can share decision making and navigation, being around others when spirits are low is great for motivation.

I thought our group, the 3 Geordigos worked really well together. We helped each other out, the craic was great and even though there we some really low points no-one vocalised them and brought the mood down. When your feeling low yourself the last thing you need is someone else constantly complaining and this never happened the talk was always positive.






What’s next

Although I’m happy with how my race went I still feel like I have unfinished business. I’d like to really push myself and see how competitive I could be, although I’m keenly aware this could result in a DNF or much slower time.

So what would I do differently?

Improve efficiency at checkpoints & spend less time on admin & faffing.

Don’t stop at some of the unofficial checkpoints such as Greggs Hut, Annies, Horneystead etc.

I don’t think I could get my pack weight down much further but I always had spare food at the end of each leg so would look to carry less.

Run more, especially in the later sections.

Be more efficient with my sleep and try to get by on less 

That will have to wait a few years though as next year I will be doing the Arctic Spine along the Kungsleden in Sweden.

Final thoughts – why do I do it?

I mused some thoughts on the “why” in my blog from last years race.

Everyone is more capable that they think and ablw to complete a race such as the Spine, but you need to have a good “why”.

When it’s the middle of the night and you’re being battered by the elements, your body is being battered and aching and all you have to look forward to is another 4/5/6 days of the same then you better have a good “why”

The Spine race is badged as “Britain’s most brutal”. It’s certainly a tough race, the toughest I’ve done and although there’s lots of trudging through boggy fields & open featureless moorland, long dark nights, inhospitable weather, extreme tiredness, sleep deprivation and soreness.

But its not all like that all of the time.


There’s long periods of solitude to think about all the things you don’t have the time to think about during everyday busy life 

There’s stunning sunrises and sunsets, beautiful starry skies, vast mountain vistas and stunning unspoilt scenery.

There’s the sense of achievement in pushing through some really dark times and coming out of the other side feeling invincible.

There’s the random people who invite you into their houses and feed you, and who come out on the trail call you by name and feed you jelly babies.

There’s the knowledge that no matter how bad the conditions get you have the skills and mentality to get through it.

There’s pushing for hours on end during the night and then be greeted by the first light of day.

There’s feeling like utter crap, sleeping for 10 minutes in the middle of a gold course on the ground in snow when it’s -5 degrees then waking up and feeling like a million dollars.

There’s the friendships, deep connections and shared experiences formed out on the trail which last a lifetime.

No other race I’ve been involved in comes close to replicating this– it’s the Spine bubble, the Spine family. It’s the reason people come back year after both as competitors and as volunteers.

That is my “why”


What makes the Spine so special?

Lets be honest – the Pennine Way isn’t the most inspiring trail in the world even in the summer.
