I’m lying face down on the ground under 3 feet of snow, it’s -30 degrees Celsius and I’m unable to move. 

Moments before I had been descending from Tjäktjapasset on cross country ski’s pulling a pulk behind me. I was fully in control and everything was going well .. until it wasn’t. Until I built up to a speed I wasn’t able to control, lost control and fell face forward into the deep snow. 

My pulk was still attached to me and now thanks to gravity and the steep terrain was pinning me to the ground.

To complicate the situation further my skis were both still attached to my feet and also buried under the snow and the pulk preventing any movement of my legs.

Welcome to the Arctic Spine, a 293 mile race along the Kungsleden Trail in Swedish Lapland

I cried out in frustration but to no avail- in Europe’s last wilderness no-one can hear you scream. I tried to remain calm, take stock of my situation and considered my options. 

Nothing is hurting so hopefully nothing is broken or seriously injured. I am warm and in no immediate danger although the longer I remained here the more my situation would deteriorate..

I can’t press the emergency button on my tracker, or send any type of message on it because my tracker is in my pulk and my pulk is busy trying to kill me.

I could get to my phone but there’s no signal for miles around. 

I could reach my whistle, attached to one of the arms on my backpack but what use would that be? 

Option 1 is stay where I am. How long will it be before anyone comes looking for me? After about an hour my satellite tracker will start beeping because I’m not moving. 

I’ve just slept at the top of the pass so there should be no reason for me to have stopped again so soon for so long. Hopefully this should be realized quickly, and a decision made to mobilize some sort of help.

Where will this help come from? If there is another participant near me they will be contacted and asked to assist. I’ve no idea who is left in the race or where they are so I have to rule that out.

There are 3 safety team in a small mountain hut I passed through last night- they could be asked to help. It took me about an hour to get to the top of the pass from this hut earlier this morning. If they come on skis maybe they could be here in around that time, if they don’t have skis and come on foot they will be post holing through deep snow and will take at least double that. They will probably assume I’m immobile or unconscious and will have no way of extracting me. I decide help via this route is unlikely.

The closest road I am aware of is over 30 miles away.

I conclude the most likely assistance will come via Sami on a snowmobile, probably with a medic in tow. How long will this take? The next mountain hut is around 15 miles further down the valley but there’s no road there and they will likely me mobilized from farther afield.

Best case scenario I estimate 3 hours before any help could be here and it could be considerably longer. On the bright side it was unlikely to be 127 hours and no bodily parts should need to be sacrificed.

This is a bad option.

Option 2 try to leverage my legs from under the pulk and try and free myself from its icy grip. This proved impossible they are firmly wedged and going nowhere.

Option 3 – try and push my hands behind my back and unclip the karabiners. This would have to be done one handed without my big mitts so I’d have enough dexterity. I briefly try this but its impossible.

Option 4 was to try and twist around and attempt to unclip the karabiners one by one with both hands. I knew that I had a limited time window to do this as my hands would become cold and numb very quickly outside the protective layer of my big mitts.

It took a considerable amount of effort even just to twist around, as the pulk also twisted with me and was constrained by the snow. I rocked back and forwards to provide some momentum before trying to hold my position and unclip the karabiner. I could open the clip but the force of the pulk pushing down meant I had to exert upward force to attempt to free it.

I lost count of how many times I tried this. Rock back and forth, reach push, try desperately to free the clip. And then after what seemed like an eternity POP it was free!! Get In!!!! Now all I had to do was repeat the procedure on the other side.

After most twisting and turning I finally managed to pop the karibiner and I was free. Sort of.

My legs were still trapped under the pulk at an awkward angle. A desperate struggle ensued involving attempting to push the pulk upwards enough to be able to pull my still ski attached feet from underneath it whist at the same time preventing it from sliding further down the hill.

This was finally achieved, and I could stand up. Or at least I could try.

Standing up with ski’s attached to your feet is difficult at the best of times, but I still had to keep hold of the pulk to prevent it from careering out of control down the steep hillside possibly never to be seen again.

By a significant amount of pulling, pushing and swearing I eventually managed to stand up and manoeuvre the pulk so that it was facing horizontally across the hill and not in any danger of spinning out of control. I took off my ski’s and retrieved my poles. Well one of them, the other was nowhere to be seen presumably buried under the snow somewhere.

After a bit of digging I managed to find it and then performed the tricky manoeuvre of descending the remaining steep section on foot manually pulling the pulk behind me.

Finally free and down from the steep ground I started to reattach everything, only to discover one of the karibiners was mangled and of no use, crap! Luckily I had a few spares but they weren’t as strong as the broken one, would they hold?

I had no idea but it was my only option so I carefully attached them and hoped for the best whilst wondering if they didn’t if gaffa tape could also be used.

I breathed a sigh of relief and finally progressed on my journey hoping that this would be the biggest issue I’d face in the race. I was wrong about that, but that’s another story….











Pre race nerves

This race has been a long time coming – I went on a weeks training course with Phil Hayday-Brown, the mastermind behind this race and the UK Spine, and a few others 2 years ago in around the same area the race was due to take place. It was originally due to take place last year but there were only 2 of us entered so was unfortunately cancelled.


As the race drew ever closer and it became apparent that it would definitely go ahead my excitement and trepidation grew in equal measures. 

There were times when I’d worry that I’d made a terrible mistake and I was completely out of my depth. In these moments I tried to rationalise my fear – what exactly was it that I was nervous about?

Although I wasn’t as fit as I’d have liked to be (when are we ever), fingers crossed fitness and conditioning shouldn’t be a limiting factor. 

I’d been on the training course and practiced all the skills I’d need in the race. I’d also pulled a home-made pulk around the Cairngorm plateau camping in freezing conditions and practiced up there with all my kit.

I’d completed the UK winter spine twice along with various other ultras and multi day events such as Dragons Back, the Itera Expedition Race and a Bob Graham Round so I had all of that experience to draw from.

I guess a lot of it was fear of the unknown. It was the inaugural running of the race, and it wasn’t just a new race it was a new type of race. There are other cold weather races such as the Yukon Arctic Ultra, Lapland Ultra, 6633 and Arrowhead. These races however take place on well groomed snowmobile tracks, dog tracks and even roads and are mostly flat so good progress can usually be made – people generally wear running shoes. They also have regular indoor support points where competitors can sleep and are provided with a hot meal.



This race was different, self sufficiency was the key. There were 3 checkpoints en-route where we would have access to a drop bag and be provided with hot water and fuel resupply but that was it. Sleeping would be outside in our tents as it would be anywhere else on the trail.

The route wasn’t flat either, it went through a number of mountain ranges rising up to 1150 metres at its highest point. Some of the route would be on snowmobile trails but most of it wouldn’t so breaking trail was a real possibility.

There was no data from previous races to draw from – no previous competitors to compare notes or race strategies, no Facebook groups full of advice (maybe that’s not such a bad thing), no idea if the race was even possible.

In this day and age apart from the depths of the ocean the entire globe has been traversed and there are no new frontiers to explore. This race seemed like the closest I would ever get to true adventure and exploration and I felt incredibly excited and privileged to be in such a position.

Ultimately though if Phil didn’t think I was capable of competing in the race he wouldn’t have let me enter and I drew some comfort from that.

My pre-race plan had been to move for around 18 hours a day with 6 hours of “rest”. 3 hours of sleep plus time either side of that to make camp, melt snow eat and dry wet kit.



Arrival in Abisko

The journey to Abisko was an adventure in itself. After 2 flights, a delayed 16 hour train journey and car ride I finally arrived, 30 hours after leaving home in Gateshead.

Upon arrival at he STF (Swedish Youth Hostel) Phil showed us to our accommodation – we had our own log cabin with 5 beds, catering facilities and plenty of room for kit faffing opportunities.

I was sharing with Dutch athletes Robi Dattatreya and Robin Imthorn who I’d met at the train station and also Mael Jouan from France.

Our hire kit (Ski’s and pulks) wasn’t ready yet so I had a leisurely stroll along to the main village and purchased up with some last minute supplies from the well stocked supermarket.

Upon returning I discovered Robin had been moved to a separate room to isolate as he’d been suffering from a nasty cough and a decision would be made tomorrow whether he would start the race.

Myself and Robi then frequented the STF restaurant where we were joined by Kev Leahy and Joe Barrs and discussed pre race strategies over some delicious  Reindeer Steak.

The next day was assessment day. 

There were 14 of us in the race and 14 people on the support team (excluding the Sami who would be ferrying people around on snowmobiles and acting as search and rescue).

We then went through the dreaded kit check with every item being pored over and scrutinised in fine detail before moving outside and being assessed on putting up our tents and using our stoves.


John emphasised the importance of wearing gloves when handling fuel. If fuel comes into contact with naked flesh in freezing conditions the warmer skin causes the fuel to evaporate, and this subsequently has a cooling effect on the skin. If the air temperature is -30, the skin will cool to -40. Its instant frostbite.

Finally we were given a very serious race briefing with lots of scary terms such as frostbite, hypothermia, avalanches and death being thrown around although the mood was lightened upon lead medic Charlotte’s warning of the arctic elephants (you had to be there).



Finally getting started and an early catastrophe



After breakfast and some last-minute faffing finally everyone was on the start line. A few photos , a motivational speech by Phil and we were off.

We started through a funnel which led to a slight downhill and a few people fell down at this point – I narrowly managed to dodge the carnage and escape unscathed. Up ahead Kev, Barclay and Joe had sped off and because of the bottleneck behind I found myself in the strange position of being alone on the trail.

A few miles in and the birch woodland  cleared opening up a vast panoramic view of the mountains we were marching towards.. I stopped to tak a few pictures at which point the army team passed me and the others caught up so I was back in the pack.

We crossed a river and proceeded on a well groomed snowmobile track. Phil had told us not to blindly follow the GPX track so I knew that we wouldn’t be on top of it straight away but we seemed to be veering further away from it which made me a little uncomfortable.

When the trail didn’t show any signs of returning to the gpx I stopped to check the map and realised that we had in fact taken the wrong turn and were now on the wrong side of the river heading into the wrong valley, shit. I cursed for making such an nav error so early on I the race. 

We all stopped and I chatted though options with Eion, there was another trail marked on the map heading  towards where we needed to be but it stopped short of the river and there were no bridges marked on the map so we’d have to beeline it and hope it was frozen.

The other option was retracing our steps back to the river crossing which I estimated to be about 30 minutes back and wasn’t an appealing prospect.

We decided on the former 

At this point there were 7 of us – myself, Robi, Malou, Eoin, Charlie, Caroline and Andrew. The army team had made the same mistake but they were out of sight ahead so we couldn’t call them back.

The trail was quite rough and steep in places, definitely not conducive to pulling a pulk but progress was ok until we reached the end of the train at a small cabin and a bridge. 

It was now pretty much a case of making a beeline, but the deep snow and thick birch forest made for torturous progress and we all took it in turns to break trail at the front.

We reached the river, only to find that it was in free flow and not frozen over, shit. We decided to flank the river upstream in the hope of finding a safe crossing at some point.

After a while we came to a snow bridge which looked like it was navigable, so we cautiously crossed it in single file.

We were back on the GPX now, but unfortunately is marked the summer trail and not the winter trail which took a slightly longer route and was further away.

There are lots of instances en-route where the summer and winter trails diverge. The winter trails are traversed by snowmobiles and skiers and as such generally take lower level more easily traversable routes.

In this instance the summer route contoured the side of a steep wooded valley whereas the winter route took a longer but flatter route around the outside of it.

We could either pick up the winter route further back or push on the summer route and convene with it further down. We decided on the latter and were again breaking trail over difficult terrain.

On a number of occasions we had to cross narrow wooded boardwalks straddling small frozen streams. It was a constant battle to prevent the pulks from slipping off the boardwalks, and we collectively worked as a team to help each other and make sure our pulks were aligned and didn’t fall off.

Eventually we hit our final barrier before joining the winter trail – a small suspension bridge to cross with steep steps on either side. Ski’s had to be taken off and a combination of man hauling, pulling, pushing and carrying got us all safely to the other side and back on track.

Seeing the red crosses again was a very welcome relief.


Back on track and into the night

After a few adrenaline packed hours the group settled into a more steady pace and started to thin out. We reached the first frozen lake caught a glimpse of the impending mountains ahead which were now much closer.

I had been feeling pretty sluggish up to this point but the steep climb up to the mountain plateau seemed to invigorate me and made good progress on the climb.

The wind picked up a little and I zipped my coat right up to give some respite. The front of the coat covered over my mouth which was nice, but unwittingly I started breathing into it – this would come back to bite me. 

One of the aspects which makes these types or adventures so challenging is the amount of time it takes to do anything. Anything that involves any type of dexterity (which is almost everything) means taking off the big gloves at a minimum which also means stopping as the gloves are attached to my poles through the straps.

Getting items out of pockets isn’t too bad, but if I need to reach anything in my rucksack it needs to be removed which means unhooking the straps attaching my gloves to my wrists otherwise they end up in a tangled mess.

If I want to sit anywhere the only option is my pulk which means straddling it and is extremely uncomfortable. Otherwise I need to remove my Ski’s which aren’t too bad to get off, but the bindings often clog up with snow and ice getting them back on and is especially challenging in deep snow.

At one point I took my gloves off completely and lay them on the snow whilst I faffed with my pulk. By the time I put them on they were like icicles and my fingers were freezing. I left them on for probably a little longer that I should hoping they would quiclly warm up once back on my hands. They didn’t.

I took them off and put them inside my coat to try and warm them and donned a thinner mid layer pair.

After around 15 minutes they were warm enough to put back on and I berated myself for such a stupid mistake. Sadly a few hours later I made the same mistake but this time the damage was irreversible, they were frozen solid so I swapped them out for my big thermal mitts.


Darkness arrived and I was treated to a wonderful starry night, I’ve never seen the sky so beautiful. I stopped a few times just to take it in, there was not a breath of air and not a noise to be heard, only endless silence.

I was now alone so had the view all to myself. I occasionally glanced back and spotted headtorches but it was impossible to tell how far away they were.

The route followed a snowmobile track which occasionally diverged causing confusion. There was only route marked on the map so I assumed that they would reconvene at some point which they did.

Due to my earlier mistake of breathing into my coat the top 5 inches or so were now covered in ice which rendered the zip useless and impossible to operate past the bottom of my neck.

After a while I spotted some objects lying on the trail – a tracker and a few small bags, they must have fallen off someone’s pulk. I picked them up in the hope that I’d be able to re-unite them with their owner at some point.

On and on into the night I pressed. As I climbed further the sky clouded over and the wind picked up which had a dramatic cooling effect and a bank of wispy clouds closed in and obscured the night sky

I spotted a flickering light ahead which I hoped marked the Tjkaa Hut but it was impossible to tell how far away it was as the surrounding area was now in total darkness.

After about an hour it didn’t seem to be getting any closer. And then I spotted a couple of other lights. Maybe they were from people in the hut. 

They came ever closer until I was able to make out the outlines of 2 people pulling pulks. I was surprised that anyone else would still be out at this time as it was well past midnight.

It was Kev and Barclay. “Are you going to hut 1” they asked. 

“Yes I am , where are you going?”

“We’ve been to hut 1, going to hut 2 now. You’re going the wrong way”

Shit, really how could that have happened? I couldn’t process it. I’d been carefully tracking my progress on my watch and cross referencing with my map to avoid a repeat of the previous mornings excitement. Also, how could I have gotten in front of Kev and Barclay  without seeing them, or passing the hut.

I double checked my watch and map – “I’m pretty sure I’m going the right way – you must have doubled back on yourselves after the hut” A check of my compass confirmed I was going south and they were heading north.

Kev checked his GPS “Shit you’re right we’ve doubled back on ourselves”

After a bit more chat it transpired it was Kev’s tracker and kit I’d found on the trail so I was able to return them to him and we all headed up to hut 1.

Entering a checkpoint in the UK Spine race you are greeted by a team of people mothering you – taking your shoes off your feet, offering you a comfortable seat next to a roaring fire and offering you refreshments. Tea of coffee? Do you want some lasagne, some chicken curry? How about a bacon sandwich or a full English breakfast. How are your feet, can I help tape them for you whilst you relax and eat your bacon sandwich, or maybe have a quick snooze? How about a nice comfortable bed?

Entering the hut (actually a tiny room about the size of the emergency huts in the Cheviots) I was greeted by John Bamber who offered to defrost my water bottles, put some hot water into a dehydrated meal and James the medic who checked my hands for signs of frostbite. There was an outside long drop toilet with a metal seat.

It wasn’t much warmer inside the hut that it was outside, intentionally so. Everyone was covered in snow, above 0 degrees snow turns into water. Once back outside water turns to ice and gets into places you don’t want it to get into, like zips and renders them useless.

Luckily mine weren’t showing any signs, but Joe (Barrs) who had arrived before me wasn’t so lucky. He was showing worrying signs in one of his fingers and was trying to rewarm them with some hand warmers and a big pair of insulated mitts.

The prognosis from James wasn’t great.

“Either you can stay here and be extracted via snowmobile, or you can push on to hut 2 and have them assessed there. Extraction from there will be a lot quicker. If you do that though under no circumstances can you let that had get cold again or your risking frost bite. “

I packed up my gear and left Joe to agonize over his decision. I really felt for him, he’d been leading the race and said that the felt amazing and was rearing to go but pushing on would be a big risk. It’s one thing to push on with a gammy ankle, some blisters or a muscle/tendon strain but quite another to risk losing a finger and it again highlighted the seriousness of the race.






A new dawn and a fall

I think I got around 15 minutes sleep before packing u and setting out into the beautiful dawn which had eluded me under the cover of last nights darkness.

Despite the lack of sleep I felt invigorated by the new day and was looking forward to some hopefully easier ski-Ing than I’d had the previous day.

I began the descent, gentle at first and easily controllable. Then steeper, and steeper and faster – concentrate you’ve got this and for a while I did. And then I didn’t and I was falling. Falling and sliding down the steep slope with my pulk pushing me from behind until I was stopped by the volume of snow.


Now past the steep section I could see the trail stretching out for miles into the distance through a large glacial valley flanked by huge mountains of both sides with views of even bigger mountains far ahead on the horizon. It was a truly mesmerising scene and I felt equal amounts of awe and humility.

Unfortunately it wasn’t the gradual easy descent I’d been anticipating and I was having to work hard to make progress. There were no snowmobile trails so I was following the tracks of those in the race who’d went before me.

After a while I spotted the shape of a body lying in the snow – it was Andrew (thankfully a live body). He’d pushed on a bit further than me last night and had now stopped to take a bivvy. We briefly chatted before he attended to his beeping tracker – presumably about the scold him for not informing the safety team of his intention to stop.

A little further on I spotted a tent in which I assumed Robi was resting. There were no signs of life, so I pushed on, not wishing to disturb him.

The excitement and adrenaline of the morning had now long worn off, I was lethargic and felt like I was moving at a snails pace.

I’d lost at least 45 minutes due to my entrapment further up the mountain and my slower than expected pace meant that the 3pm cut-off which at the beginning of the day seemed like a challenging but achievable target now seemed like an impossible one. At my current pace I worked out it would be around 4:30 by the time I reached it.

When you compete in any other type of foot race you have a number of gears available to you, from a slow death march, a brisk walk, slow bimbly run and even flat out sprinting (normally reserved for the last few hundred metres of the race). 

It seemed as if I had only one gear and that gear was crawl. Then the trail began to climb again, wtf I thought it was all downhill from the pass, surely this can’t be right? But a quick check of the map revealed that the trail did indeed climb up to flank the hillside before dropping down on the other side to the next hut.


This was a real low point in the race for me, I was going to be timed out before I even reached the first checkpoint. Would they enforce the cutoff? I knew there were still people behind me so I wouldn’t be the only one but I just didn’t know. All I knew was that I just had to keep moving forward.

Then to compound matters the weather changed. It started to snow – not heavily but the visibility dropped considerably, and I was soon in a whiteout, being able to see only the red crosses marking the trail in front of me. I couldn’t even make out the trail beneath my feet. 

I slowly trudged on and then my tracker began to beep. I performed the slow ritual of manoeuvring to retrieve the tracker from my pulk and read the message.

“Nice try Rob, not a bad effort but unfortunately hut 2 is the end of your race. And really, what were you thinking of entering this race it’s clearly well outside of your capabilities”.

That’s what I was expecting, instead it read 

“You are going well, the cut-off at hut 2 has been extended to 5pm keep going”.

Ok so it wasn’t the end of my race after all, I pushed on with a renewed vigour.

Then about 15 minutes it started beeping again. I cursed as I had put it back in my pulk. I carried on going for a few minutes contemplating what information it may contain.

Eventually the beeping was threatening to send me mad and I had to check. 

“Competitors will be assessed as hut 2 and if fit will be allowed to continue”

Ok, I put the tracker in my pocket to avoid any more wasted time pulling it in and out of my pulk.

I was almost at hut 2 when I glanced behind and spotted someone else coming up the trail. I was fully expecting this, Robi, Andrew had caught me up due to my snail like pace. But no, it was Kev! Wtf

“Hi Kev, you alright” I enquired. 

“Aye, I took a wrong turn back there lost a load of time”

“Shit mate, well at least your back on track now”

And so we entered the next hut together and were greeted by the safety team. I asked how many people had been through so far. “None, you’re the first” 

Wow, I was flabbergasted as was Kev. 

We entered a small room with barely enough space to fit us in and performed the usual faffing routine. Eat a dehydrated meal, try and briefly charge my headtorch battery and phone, go to the outdoors  frozen long drop toilet. At least this one had a polystyrene seat – luxury!




Despite shovelling a load of snacky food into my mouth I was lacking energy 

Using a liquid fuel stove is very different from a gas stove which you usually just open the valve, light and hey presto you have a roaring flame.

The problem with gas is that it doesn’t perform well, or indeed at all sometimes in sub zero conditions so liquid fuel stoves are much more reliable and efficient.

First of all you have to pressurise the fuel bottle by pumping it a number of times. The stove then needs to be primed which involves releasing a small about of fuel into a cup that sits beneath the burner and lighting it (I made sure to keep one of my lighters close to my body). This warms the fuel line which then enables the fuel to be vapourised and produce a nice controlled blue flame.

This process is fraught with danger and stoves have a tendency to flare up producing football size fireballs which can instantly reduce tents to ash so it’s a task best done outside.




There was silence. Silence apart from the noises from the pulk and from the ski’s.

The crunch , crunch , crunch squeak of my poles digging into the hard snow.


Looking back now some of the mistakes I made seem trivial and its hard to understand how I could have made them.

The ice on my tent couldn’t have possibly been fuel which had leaked from the bottle because fuel doesn’t freeze at that temperature. Otherwise if would freeze inside the bottle, and I would have surely been able to smell it.

If I’d realised this I would have also realised that my fuel bottle was still full, so I could have tried to address the issue with my pump. I suspect that the lack of friction was due to the rubber contracting in the cold conditions and thus not providing sufficient pressure. I could have tried warming it next to my body and lubricating the plunger.

I’ve since discovered (thanks to John Bamber) that you can but pumps specially designed for sub-zero temperatures so I will certainly be investing in one.

In retrospect I believe it was my flask which had leaked which would also explain the less that boiling water in it. Alex had commented back in hut 2 when he filled it up that the top wasn’t closed snugly which is something I’ve noticed before but its never leaked. Until now at the exact moment I didn’t want it to leak.



Day 3

I managed a little more sleep than the previous night, maybe 30 minutes. The first thing I did was to retrieve my mitts from my sleeping bag hoping that they had dried out but I was horrified to discover that they were moist all the way through, shit!!

Upon checking my boots I also found them to be frozen solid and I was unable to even get my feet in them. The zips were frozen and I was unable to move them, and I also noticed small patches of ice on the outsides of each boot at the forefoot area.

Upon further inspection I discovered the stitching was starting to come away at the side of the boots and ice was forming in the gaps.

Without a stove I couldn’t dry anything out.

My fingertips also felt a little numb at the tips. 

Again, I was in a bad situation and had to make a decision. 

I felt warm enough inside the sleeping bag, I had plenty  food and about 1l of water – I was comfortable and in no immediate danger.

I fumbled around with the tracker and sent a message to race HQ “All gloves wet or frozen, stove is broke”

Back came the reply “are you safe and warm”

“Yes, in sleeping bag in tent” I responded

“Can you confirm if you need assistance”

“Yes” I replied

“We will contact safety team and get back to you”

I relaxed a little, help was on the way. Or at least it would be. There was nothing else I could really do other than put my head down and try and get some sleep.

After a while another message popped up “Sami on way 3 hours. Bringing gloves and stove. Could you carry on?”

This was a surprise – I’d assumed this was the end of my race there was no way I was going to make the 1pm cutoff (it would be 9:30 before the Sami arrived) but now I was being given an option.

I pondered the question before replying “Yes but won’t make cutoff?” 

No reply was forthcoming, the question remained unanswered and I lay there waiting.

The roar or a snowmobile engine signalled the arrival on the Sami and he delivered his promised items or a stove, fuel and a pair of big mitts.

I got the stove going as he asked me what I wanted to do. What are my options I asked back.

You can either continue in the race, or came back to CP1 with me on a snowmobile. He also told me that other than myself there were only now 2 people left in the race.

My tracker beeped, “is Sami there? Cutoff has been lifted do you wish to continue”

Whatever my decision I knew that I had to thaw out my boots enough for me to be able to get my feet into them so I brought the stove inside the tent, shut to door and carefully held the boots as close to the roaring flame as I dared.

My finger tips were throbbing and numb and I asked the Sami for his opinion. After a cursory glance he replied that just because my fingers are numb it doesn’t mean that I have frostbite, but I’m not a doctor.

I inspected them again myself. They looked normal, there were no white patches or other discoloration and they felt malleable to touch.

Ok, lets think this through.

I now had a stove and a warm pair of gloves so I could melt snow and dry equipment.

It was about 25 miles to CP1 – at my current pace I calculated it would take at least 13 hours to get there, most of it being during the night.

I had some stiffness and niggles but assuming nothing deteriorated then nothing should stop be physically moving. I also had plenty food.

My hands weren’t showing any signs of frostbite but I suspected that I had frostnip (which is the pre-cursor to frostbite) and that meant that under no circumstances could I allow them to become cold again. Could I guarantee that for the next 13 hours? For the next 6 days?

If I made it to CP1 then what next? If was quite clear that the race wasn’t going to finish in Hemavan, but if not there then where? And when? Would it just be a case of keeping moving for 6 more days to see how far I could get? Would there be any more cutoffs?

I wanted the Sami to tell me that I had put in a heroic effort, that I should feel proud of myself for getting this far but that I really should call it a day now rather than putting myself in any more unnecessary danger and risking permanent damage to my hands or even death.

Or maybe I wanted him to tell me to stop being so soft, to get my shit together and get my arse moving – I haven’t got all day to hang around looking at you feeling sorry for yourself you know.

He just stood there staring at me with an emotionless face. I wasn’t going to get any help here this was my decision alone.

Mentally and physically I wasn’t ready to leave the race but what would my goal now be if I continued? What experiences and learnings could I get from the race that I hadn’t already? 

After about 45 minutes my boots had thawed out enough that I could shoehorn my feet into them with a bit of force but they were like blocks of ice and I still couldn’t budge the zips to fasten them up, nor could either of the Sami.

That was the final straw I called it and my race was over. 

All that was left to go was to pack up camp and accept the snowmobile ride to CP1.

I’ve never ridden on a snowmobile before but had always wanted to.

There was no safety briefing or instruction, it was just a case of hop onto the back and cling on for dear life.

I can’t explain how exhilarating that ride was, it’s one of the highlights of my life. Over hills, across frozen lakes and skilfully weaving through dense birch forest we sped sometimes t speeds close to 50mph. Vast landscapes opened up all around or soaring mountain ranges vast frozen lakes and huge birch forests. Just when I thought the scenery couldn’t improve we crested another ridge and the view was even better.

The sun was out in full force, treating us to a Sun Dog.

It was breath-taking and terrifying in equal measures. As one point coming down a steep hill off camber the Sami stacked it and we both went flying off landing unhurt in the deep snow. The Sami apologised but we both laughed about it before rolling the snowmobile back over and jumping on again.

We stopped en-route to pick up Robi who had retired from the race and was resting in one of the mountain huts and also passed Ed and Kev, now the only 2 remaining people in the race.

Upon arrival at Stora we were greeted by Phil who kindly looked after us, followed up by Charlotte to give us a medical check.

She confirmed the frostnip in my fingers but was happy how they responded after re-warming. Robi wasn’t so lucky, she suspected mild frost-bite and advised him to check into the emergency department in the nearest hospital. 

Dean kindly dove us to the nearest towns from which we could plan our return journeys. For me that was spending the night in Gallivere before a 17 hour train journey to Stockholm and subsequent flights back to Newcastle.

Robi went on to Kiruna to check into the hospital there.

Epilogue






With these type of events there is only so much that you can train and prepare for

Similar to other non stop races it’s the attrition that gets you, it’s the little things that 

My biggest lesson is management of my hands. Every time I took my gloves off my hands got cold.

I started off with 

Wearing vapour barrier gloves (i.e. a plastic surgical glove) will stop sweat getting into my big gloves – I will be practicing that. Similarly, water barrier socks do the same for your feet. I did have a pair of WB socks with me but they didn’t feel comfortable, and I was concerned about blisters so I chose not to wear them which turned out to be a mistake.

You almost form a relationship with your stove it’s such an essential piece of kit. 

Will I be back next year for another go?

You’ll have to wait and see, but anyone who knows me already knows the answer to that………



Kit

Boring bit on what kit I used for the race:


Alpina Outlander BC boots. I really liked the boots however they both started to split along the seams on both sides after day 2. I’ve since spoken to the shop and they think its because the boot has too much volume for my feet and hence was flexing more and putting more pressure on the stitching.

Merino wool socks. My feet were never cold during the race, however the reason my boots froze on day 2 was because too much sweat had permeated into the boot. In future I will be wearing water vapour barrier socks.

Montane Phase Waterproof gaiters

Dare 2 B Salopettes

Running shorts

I also carried a pair of thermal leggings but didn’t wear then in the race my legs were never cold


Alpkit Kepler merino wool base layer

OMM Mid Layer

Montane Protium Hoodie

Montane *** Goretex Hardshell Jacket

Alpkit Fantom Down Jacket



North Face beanie hat

Numerous buffs



Wrist warmers

Thin liner glove

Black Diamond Legend leather gloves

DexShell ThermFit Waterproof Gloves

Montane Alpine 850 Down Mitts

I found the best combination to be wrist warmers, a thin liner gloves, the Dexshell gloves with the big mitts over the top. 


Hilleberg Soulo BL tent

North Face Inferno -40 sleeping bag

Closed cell sleeping mat


MSR Whisperlite International Stove & maintenance kit

Home made stove board


Electronics

Iphone  - no signal anywhere en-route but battery held out for photos

Intu 20Mpah power bank

Peztl Actik Core Head torch *2

Garmin 64s with talky toaster maps installed

Garmin Epix Pro 2 watch

Only needed 100 lumens brightness the majority of the time. Used watch for nav the majority of the time in combination with the map. Never needed to use the 64s


Water carrying capacity.

1l Stanley food Flask
500ml Stanley food flask
2 * 1l Nalgene bottles, 1 with insulated sleeve


Water froze too easily in the Nalgene’s and I didn’t have time to keep topping them up with warm water from the flask. Better solution would be a larger flask and 1 bottle.
