I've been running for around 15 years now since taking the sport back up in my early 30's and I run for Saltwell Harriers.

I first started out running on road but in the past 6 or so years I've transitioned into running on the fells which is where I spend most of my free time these days.

I also love nothing more that heading out the door with a backpack and  some lightweight kit and see where my feet take me.

Most recently I've completed the winter Spine race, attempted the Dragons Back race twice, supported many Bob Graham rounds (and completed my own in 2017) ran around the Alps and fastpacked around Iceland. 

In February 2022 I'm off to Arctic Sweden to take part in a training course with the aim of competing in a race there in 2023.

I'm also competing in a 5 day adventure race in August 2022 which will be a first for me.
