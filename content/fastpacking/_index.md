When I'm not running in the fells you can probably find me fastpacking in the fells. 

What is fastpacking I hear you say? 

Much has been written about the subject which I don't intend duplicating here but let me share my approach.

In a nutshell fastpacking is travelling for more than one day taking a lighweight approach. The benefts are it allows you to travel quicker and further. THe flipside is that you need to sacrifice some home comforts and high quality lightweight gear can be eye wateringly expensive.

Fastpacking can be done via a variety of methods of transport (foot, bike, kayak, ski-ing) but my main method is by foot (although I'd like to do more by bike in the future).


Most recenty I've fastpacked :

- Pennine Way
- Hadrians Wall Path
- Cleveland Way
- Around the Cairngorms
- Tyne and Wear Heritage Trail
- Around Iceland 

As well as countless multi-day trips and overnighters in Scotland, The Lake District and Cheviots.

I've also completed the OMM in 2019 and 2020 which is a type of fastpacking.
