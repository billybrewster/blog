My main concern going into the race was my knee as I’ve been suffering from tendonitis which has curtailed my training, I barely ran for the four weeks preceding the race although I did manage to do some hiking with help of poles on the descents.
Ultimately though what stopped me was the heat and cramp.
At the start line The cramp started kicking in after around six hours on the descent coming down to the checkpoint at Ogwen but other than that I was feeling okay.</description></item><item><title>Bob Graham Round</title><link>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/posts/bgr2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/posts/bgr2017/</guid><description>Well all good things must come to an end and my Bob Graham journey came to an end when I climbed the stairs and touched the door of the Moot Hall in Keswick at 7:19pm Saturday 24th June.
It was the culmination of 7 months of training and around 5 years of planning, procrastinating, talking and preparation – to say I was happy is an understatement.
I was working on a 22 hour schedule and my training had went well so I was confident going into round.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/about/</guid><description>Who am I?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/video/video/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/video/video/</guid><description>          </description></item></channel></rss>
