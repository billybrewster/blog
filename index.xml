My main concern going into the race was my knee as I’ve been suffering from tendonitis which has curtailed my training, I barely ran for the four weeks preceding the race although I did manage to do some hiking with help of poles on the descents.

The cramp started kicking in after around six hours on the descent coming down to the checkpoint at Ogwen but other than that I was feeling okay.</description></item><item><title>Fighting the Dragon 2</title><link>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/posts/my-second-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://billybrewster.github.io/blog/posts/my-second-post/</guid><description>So I didn’t complete the Dragon’s Back Race this year.
