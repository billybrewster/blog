I’ve known about the Spine Race for a very long time now and have spent countless years watching the steady progress of dots moving northwards over the course of a week in January.
It’s always been a race that has terrified me.
The route follows the 268 miles of the Pennine Way over generally high exposed ground from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish borders with few opportunities for shelter.</description></item><item><title>Spine Race 2022</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/running/spine2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/running/spine2022/</guid><description>So what it all this Spine malarky all about then?

My main concern going into the race was my knee as I’ve been suffering from tendonitis which has curtailed my training, I barely ran for the four weeks preceding the race although I did manage to do some hiking with help of poles on the descents.
Ultimately though what stopped me was the heat and cramp.
At the start line The cramp started kicking in after around six hours on the descent coming down to the checkpoint at Ogwen but other than that I was feeling okay.</description></item><item><title>Fighting the Dragon</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/running/dragonsback2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/running/dragonsback2021/</guid><description>So I didn’t complete the Dragon’s Back Race this year.

It’s very subjective and impossible to compare something like the Spine to The Marathon Des Sables or Badwater they all have different challenges. The Dragons Back goes for a specific niche “The toughest mountain race in the world”- it’s a hard statement to argue against.

It is similar in terms of ascent and distance but widely considered much tougher because of the roughness of the terrain and lack of trods/footpaths.
Given the reccying I had done I definitely agreed with this and knew that it was going to be a challenge to complete in under 24 hours which was my goal and my schedule.</description></item><item><title>Paddy Buckley Round 2018</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/running/paddybuckly2018/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2018 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/running/paddybuckly2018/</guid><description>Even before I had completed my Bob Graham Round last year I had decided that my next big challenge was going to be a Paddy Buckley Round.
