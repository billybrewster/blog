I’m soaked to the skin and the wind feels like its blowing right through me. I’ve lost the path and my headtorch is failing. I feel like I’m on the brink of hypothermia.
This is how my first attempt at a Paddy Buckley Round ended 6 years ago (you can read about it here )).
I’d always intended to return for another go (I’d fast packed the round over 3 days with Katherine Davis a few years back which was a great experience), but for one reason or another I never have.</description></item><item><title>Arctic Spine Race 2024</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/posts/arcticspine2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/posts/arcticspine2024/</guid><description>I’m lying face down on the ground under 3 feet of snow, it’s -30 degrees Celsius and I’m unable to move.
Moments before I had been descending from the Tjäktja Pass on cross country ski’s pulling a pulk behind me. I was fully in control and everything was going well .. until it wasn’t. Until I built up to a speed I wasn’t able to control, lost control and fell face forward into the deep snow.</description></item><item><title>The straw that broke the Dragons Back</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/posts/dragonsback2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/posts/dragonsback2023/</guid><description>“If you could take one source of pain away what would it be? And you can’t just say your feet it needs to be a specific part of a foot”
Danny thinks for a while before responding.
“The inside of my right foot where I have a bunion and its pressing against my shoe – what about you?”
There’s lots to choose from. First thing in the day it would have been the outside of my left foot (I thought I might have broken it at one point) but this has now been superseded by pain on the balls of my feet mainly caused by swelling.</description></item><item><title>Northern Traverse 2023</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/posts/northerntraverse2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/posts/northerntraverse2023/</guid><description>What do you call a cheese that isn&amp;rsquo;t yours? Nacho cheese!
It’s around 4am in the morning and I’m trudging through the moors above Shap on a cold crisp spring night. I’ve been moving pretty much non-stop for about 20 hours. It’s the witching hours just before dawn and I’m at a low point both mentally and physically.
I have 3 companions – they are also at a low point and we are resorting to humour to attempt to lift our spirits, hence the cheese jokes (I’ll spare you the rest….</description></item><item><title>Northern Traverse 2023</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/running/northerntraverse2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/running/northerntraverse2023/</guid><description>Northern Traverse 2023 What do you call a cheese that isn&amp;rsquo;t yours?

What better an adventure to have over the long bank holiday jubilee weekend.
When planning the trip I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be able to cover the 96 miles in 3 days relatively comfortably.</description></item><item><title>Paddy Buckley 2022</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/fastpacking/paddy2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/fastpacking/paddy2022/</guid><description>I made an unsucessful attempt at a Paddy Buckley Round bak in 2018 (see write up https://robbrooks.run/running/paddybuckly2018/) and it&amp;rsquo;s been on my radar to have another go ever since but for a number of reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the chance to go back.
A free long weekend in April presented the opportunity to fastpack the route over 3 days - the forecast was dry and relatively warm but windy. Katherine was wanting to do some big miles in preparation for her upcoming Bob Graham Round (which she stormed round in 21 hours 42 mins) so I asked her if she wanted tto come along.</description></item><item><title>Spine Race 2022</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/posts/spine2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/posts/spine2022/</guid><description>So what it all this Spine malarky all about then?

My main concern going into the race was my knee as I’ve been suffering from tendonitis which has curtailed my training, I barely ran for the four weeks preceding the race although I did manage to do some hiking with help of poles on the descents.
Ultimately though what stopped me was the heat and cramp.
At the start line The cramp started kicking in after around six hours on the descent coming down to the checkpoint at Ogwen but other than that I was feeling okay.</description></item><item><title>Fighting the Dragon</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/running/dragonsback2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/running/dragonsback2021/</guid><description>So I didn’t complete the Dragon’s Back Race this year.

I first started out running on road but in the past 6 or so years I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned into running on the fells which is where I spend most of my free time these days.
I also love nothing more that heading out the door with a backpack and some lightweight kit and see where my feet take me.</description></item><item><title>Arctic Spine Race 2024</title><link>https://robbrooks.run/arctic/spine2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://robbrooks.run/arctic/spine2024/</guid><description>I’m lying face down on the ground under 3 feet of snow, it’s -30 degrees Celsius and I’m unable to move.

When I heard the Spine team were going to be launching a race based in Arctic Sweden I was immediately interested but also very apprehensive. I have spent many a day and night in some pretty horrendous conditions in the UK but nothing like surviving in temperatures as low as -40 degrees C, strong winds and limited daylight hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
